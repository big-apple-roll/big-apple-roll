# 2025 design

Each year we use a different design for the event.
Here are the things we need for the 2025 edition.

## 1. Logo

The logo should represents Big Apple Roll: an international rollerblading event taking place in New York City.

Some examples of the previous year can be found in [archives](archives). Some early explorations can also be found in [archives/2025](archives/2025).

The logo should be delivered in vectorial format (SVG, AI, EPS) and in raster format (PNG, JPG).

Deadline: Mid-March

### Social media variants and color palette

We'll need a few variants of the logo that could work well for social media:

- Avatar
- Hero image (cover)

We'll also need a color palette that can be used for the website, social media, and other promotional materials.

## 2. T-shirts

Once the logo is finalized, we'll need a design for the t-shirt. We usually use [https://www.customink.com](https://www.customink.com) to print them.
The t-shirt should use the logo, and mention "Big Apple Roll" and "2025"

We could also use some design for some other merchandising like stickers, caps, etc.

Deadline: End of March

## 3. Web design (optional)

The website will be redesigned with this year logo and color palette. We can handle this part ourself, but would appreciate any help or ideas you could provide.
