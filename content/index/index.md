### What is Big Apple Roll?

Big Apple Roll (BAR) is an annual rollerblading event that brings skaters from all over the world to the streets of New York City every first week-end of August. It’s a weekend packed with group skates through the city’s iconic landmarks, social events, and an incredible sense of community. Whether you're a seasoned skater or just getting started, BAR is all about having fun, meeting new people, and exploring NYC on wheels. Come roll with us and experience the city like never before!
