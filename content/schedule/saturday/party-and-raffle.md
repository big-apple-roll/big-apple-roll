Celebrate street skating in New York City and the end of the 2025 Big Apple Roll at our annual Saturday Night Party & Raffle presented by Rollerblade.

This year’s Saturday night party will be held at Connolly's on 47th St! The BAR is providing a wide selection of heavy appetizers to accommodate most diets (reach out with any questions). Drinks on your own—Connolly's has a full bar and a great selection of beers on tap!

This is where our famous raffle is held, featuring prizes from all our wonderful sponsors. You need a [ticket to attend which you can buy here](/shop/saturday-party-ticket/), and you probably want to get some [raffle tickets](/shop/raffle-ticket/) as well.
