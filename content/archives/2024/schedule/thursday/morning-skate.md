**Alternate route:**

This alternate skate will stop at Pier 76 after 3.5 miles on the car-free Hudson River Greenway. Skaters may opt to stay at Pier 76 for a slalom / wizard skating / hangout session, instead of completing the rest of the route. This is also a good option if you are _not ready for street skating / bridges_. The skate will not return to Pier 76, so you must skate or take transit (subway or NYC ferry â€” shoes required for both) back to the hotel at a time of your choosing.
