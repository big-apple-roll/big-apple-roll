Join the country’s largest social skate, Wednesday Night Skate, for some of the best street skating NYC has to offer. WNS at last year’s BAR saw over 400 skaters, so if you’re in NYC early, don’t sleep on this long-standing NYC tradition. WNS is a fairly casual, social skate around the streets of NYC. It may or may not include bridges, hills, ramps, overpasses, sidewalks, etc. Check out [Wednesday Night Skate on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wednesdaynightskatenyc/).
